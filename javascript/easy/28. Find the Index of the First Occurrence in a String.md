```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} haystack
 * @param {string} needle
 * @return {number}
 */
var strStr = function(haystack, needle) {
    return haystack.indexOf(needle);
};
```

This code defines a function `strStr` in JavaScript that finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring `needle` within a string `haystack`. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The function takes in two parameters: `haystack`, which represents the string to search within, and `needle`, which represents the substring to search for.
- The code uses the `indexOf` method of the `haystack` string to find the index of the first occurrence of `needle`.
- The `indexOf` method returns the index of the first occurrence of `needle` within `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not found.
- The function directly returns the result of `haystack.indexOf(needle)`.

Overall, the code finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring within a string by using the built-in `indexOf` method and returning the result.
