    let left = 1
    let right = x

    while(left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)
        let squ = mid * mid

        if (squ == x) {
            return mid
        } else if (squ < x) {
            left = mid + 1

```

This code defines a function `mySqrt` that calculates the square root of a non-negative integer `x`. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- It checks if `x` is equal to 0. If so, it returns 0 since the square root of 0 is 0.
- It initializes `left` and `right` variables to represent the left and right bounds of the search range for the square root.
- The code enters a loop that continues as long as the left bound is less than or equal to the right bound.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the middle value `mid` as the average of the left and right bounds using integer division.
- It calculates the square of `mid` and stores it in the variable `squ`.
- It compares `squ` with `x`:
  - If they are equal, it means `mid` is the square root of `x`, so the code returns `mid`.
  - If `squ` is less than `x`, it means the current middle value is too small, so the left bound is updated to `mid + 1`.
  - If `squ` is greater than `x`, it means the current middle value is too large, so the right bound is updated to `mid - 1`.
- The loop continues until the left bound becomes greater than the right bound, indicating that the search range has been exhausted.
- Finally, the code returns the right bound as the closest integer value to the square root of `x`.

Overall, the code performs a binary search within the range of possible square root values to find the closest integer approximation to the square root of the input `x`.
