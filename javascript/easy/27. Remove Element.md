```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} val
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeElement = function(nums, val) {
    var i = 0;
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] != val) {
            nums[i++] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i;
};
```

This code defines a function `removeElement` in JavaScript that removes all occurrences of a specific value `val` from an array `nums` and returns the new length of the modified array. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The function takes in two parameters: `nums`, which represents the array of numbers, and `val`, which represents the value to be removed.
- It initializes a variable `i` to keep track of the next available position in the modified array.
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through each element of the array.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the current element at index `j` is equal to `val`.
  - If they are not equal, it means the element should be kept. It assigns the current element to the position `i` in the array and increments `i` by 1 to prepare for the next available position.
- After processing all elements, `i` represents the new length of the modified array, where all occurrences of `val` are removed.
- The function returns `i`, the new length of the modified array.

Overall, the code removes all occurrences of a specific value from an array by iterating through the elements, keeping the elements that are not equal to the specified value, and updating the array in-place to retain only the desired elements.
