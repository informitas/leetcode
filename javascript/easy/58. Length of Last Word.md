```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var lengthOfLastWord = function(s) {
    const splitted = s.trim().split(' ')
    return splitted[splitted.length - 1].length
};
```

This code defines a function `lengthOfLastWord` that takes in a string `s` and returns the length of the last word in the string. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The code starts by trimming the input string `s` using the `trim()` method. This removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string.
- It then splits the trimmed string into an array of words using the `split(' ')` method, where the space character `' '` is used as the delimiter. This effectively separates the string into individual words.
- The resulting array `splitted` contains all the words from the string, excluding any leading or trailing whitespace.
- Finally, the code returns the length of the last word in the `splitted` array by accessing the last element with `splitted[splitted.length - 1]` and retrieving its `length` property.

Overall, the code trims the input string, splits it into words, and returns the length of the last word in the string.
