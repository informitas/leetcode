```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let j = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
            nums[++j] = nums[i];
        }
    }
    return j + 1;
};
```

This code defines a function `removeDuplicates` in JavaScript that removes duplicates from a sorted array `nums` and returns the length of the modified array. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The function takes in one parameter: `nums`, which represents the sorted array.
- It initializes a variable `j` to keep track of the last index of the unique elements in the array.
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
- Inside the loop, it compares the element at index `j` with the element at index `i`.
  - If they are not equal, it means a new unique element is found. It increments `j` by 1, updates the value at index `j` to the new unique element, and moves forward to the next element.
- After the loop, `j` represents the index of the last unique element, so `j + 1` gives the length of the modified array without duplicates.
- The function returns the length of the modified array.

Overall, the code removes duplicates from a sorted array by comparing elements and updating the array in-place to keep only the unique elements.
