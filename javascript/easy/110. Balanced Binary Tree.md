```

This code defines a function `isBalanced` that takes a `root` node of a binary tree and determines whether the tree is balanced or not. Here's how the code works:

- The function `isBalanced` defines a nested function `dfs` (depth-first search) that takes a `node` as an argument and returns the height of the subtree rooted at that node.
- If the `node` is `null`, indicating an empty subtree, the `dfs` function returns 0.
- Otherwise, it recursively calculates the height of the left and right subtrees by adding 1 to the heights of their respective child nodes.
- If the absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, it means the tree is unbalanced, so the `dfs` function returns `Infinity` to indicate this.
- Otherwise, it returns the maximum height between the left and right subtrees.
- In the main `isBalanced` function, it calls `dfs` with the `root` node to calculate the height of the entire tree.
- If the result of `dfs(root)` is `Infinity`, it means the tree is unbalanced, so the function returns `false`.
- Otherwise, it returns `true`, indicating that the tree is balanced.

Note that the code assumes the `TreeNode` class is defined with the specified attributes (`val`, `left`, and `right`).
