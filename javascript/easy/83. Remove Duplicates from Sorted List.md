var deleteDuplicates = function(head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null)
        return head;
    let curr = head;
    while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
        if (curr.val == curr.next.val) {
            curr.next = curr.next.next;
        } else {
            curr = curr.next;
        }
    }
    return head;
};
```

This code defines a function `deleteDuplicates` that removes duplicates from a sorted singly-linked list. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The function takes a parameter `head`, which represents the head of the linked list.
- It checks if the list is empty (`head == null`) or contains only one node (`head.next == null`). In these cases, there are no duplicates to remove, so the function returns the original `head`.
- If the list has at least two nodes, the function initializes a variable `curr` to point to the `head` of the list.
- It uses a loop that continues as long as `curr` and `curr.next` are not null, indicating that there are more nodes to process.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the value of the current node (`curr.val`) is equal to the value of the next node (`curr.next.val`). If they are equal, it means there is a duplicate node.
- To remove the duplicate node, it updates the `next` pointer of the current node (`curr.next`) to skip the next node and point to the node after it (`curr.next.next`).
- If the values are not equal, it means the current node is distinct, and it moves `curr` to the next node by assigning `curr.next` to `curr`.
- After the loop, the function returns the modified `head` of the linked list, where duplicates have been removed.

Overall, the code traverses the linked list and removes duplicates by adjusting the `next` pointers of the nodes. It only keeps the distinct nodes in the resulting list.
