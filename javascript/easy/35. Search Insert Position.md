```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var searchInsert = function(nums, target) {
    let start = 0
    let end = nums.length - 1
    let ans = nums.length

    while (start <= end) {
        const mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2)

        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid
        else if (nums[mid] < target) start = mid + 1
        else {
            ans = mid
            end = mid - 1
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
```

This code defines a function `searchInsert` that takes in an array of numbers `nums` and a target number `target`, and returns the index where the target number should be inserted in the sorted array. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- It initializes two pointers, `start` and `end`, to the start and end indices of the array.
- It also initializes a variable `ans` to the length of the array, assuming the target number should be inserted at the end of the array.
- The code uses a binary search algorithm to find the correct insertion position.
- Inside the while loop, it calculates the midpoint index `mid` using `Math.floor((start + end) / 2)`.
- It then compares the value at index `mid` with the target number.
  - If they are equal, it means the target number is already present at index `mid`, so the function returns `mid`.
  - If the value at index `mid` is less than the target number, it means the target number should be inserted to the right of `mid`, so it updates `start` to `mid + 1`.
  - If the value at index `mid` is greater than the target number, it means the target number should be inserted to the left of `mid`, so it updates `ans` to `mid` and updates `end` to `mid - 1`.
- After the while loop, if the target number was not found in the array, the function returns `ans`, which represents the correct insertion position.

Overall, the code performs a binary search to find the index where a target number should be inserted in a sorted array and returns the result.
