        "X": 10,

    let result = 0;

    for(let i=0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const cur = dict[s[i]]
        const next = dict[s[i+1]]

        if (cur < next) {
            result += next - cur;
            i++;

This code defines a function `romanToInt` in JavaScript that converts a Roman numeral string `s` to its corresponding integer value. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The function takes in a single parameter, `s`, which represents the Roman numeral string to be converted.
- It initializes an object `dict` that maps each Roman numeral character to its corresponding integer value.
- A variable `result` is initialized to store the final converted integer value.
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in the Roman numeral string.
- Inside the loop, it retrieves the value of the current character `cur` from the `dict`.
- It also retrieves the value of the next character `next` from the `dict` by accessing `s[i+1]`.
- It compares the values of `cur` and `next` to determine if subtraction is needed.
  - If `cur` is less than `next`, it means a subtraction is needed. In this case, the value of `next - cur` is added to the `result`, and the loop increments `i` by one to skip the next character.
  - Otherwise, if `cur` is greater than or equal to `next`, it means no subtraction is needed. In this case, the value of `cur` is added to the `result`.
- After the loop completes, the method returns the `result`, which represents the converted integer value.

Overall, the code converts a Roman numeral string to its corresponding integer value by iterating through the characters, applying the necessary rules for subtraction and addition based on the values retrieved from the `dict`, and accumulating the result in the `result` variable.
