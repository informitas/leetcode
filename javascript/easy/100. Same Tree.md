/**

var isSameTree = function(p, q) {
    if (!p && !q) return true;
    if (!p || !q || p.val !== q.val) return false;
    return isSameTree(p.right, q.right) && isSameTree(p.left, q.left);
};
```

This code defines a function `isSameTree` that checks whether two binary trees are the same. It takes two `TreeNode` objects, `p` and `q`, as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the trees are the same.

Here's how the code works:

- The function checks if both `p` and `q` are `null` (indicating empty trees). If they are, it returns `true` since two empty trees are considered the same.
- It also checks if either `p` or `q` is `null` (but not both). If that's the case, it returns `false` since one tree is empty while the other is not, indicating they are not the same.
- It further checks if the values of the current nodes, `p.val` and `q.val`, are different. If they are, it returns `false` since the trees cannot be the same.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it recursively calls the `isSameTree` function on the right subtrees (`p.right` and `q.right`) and the left subtrees (`p.left` and `q.left`).
- The recursion continues until the base cases are reached: when both `p` and `q` are `null` (indicating two empty trees) or when the values of the current nodes are different.
- If all recursive calls return `true` (indicating the right and left subtrees are the same), the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Note that the code assumes the `TreeNode` function is defined with the specified attributes (`val`, `left`, and `right`), and it uses the strict equality operator (`!==`) to compare the values of the nodes.
