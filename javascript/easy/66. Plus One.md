```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} digits
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var plusOne = function(digits) {
    const number = BigInt(digits.join('')) + 1n;
    const str = number.toString();

    return str.split("");
};
```

This code defines a function `plusOne` that takes in an array of digits and returns a new array that represents the input number incremented by one. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The code first converts the input array `digits` into a single number by joining the elements together using the `join('')` method and then converting it to a `BigInt` to handle large numbers.
- It adds `1n` to the `BigInt` number to increment it by one.
- The incremented number is then converted back to a string using the `toString()` method and assigned to the `str` variable.
- Finally, the code splits the string `str` into an array of individual digits using the `split("")` method, which creates an array with each digit as a separate element.

Overall, the code converts the input array of digits into a number, increments it by one, converts the result back to a string, and then splits it into an array of individual digits. The resulting array represents the incremented number.
