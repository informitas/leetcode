```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isPalindrome = function(x) {
    x = String(x)
    return x == [...x].reverse().join("")
};
```

This code defines a function `isPalindrome` in JavaScript that checks whether a given number `x` is a palindrome. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The function takes in a single parameter, `x`, which represents the number to be checked for palindrome property.
- Inside the function, the code converts the number `x` to a string using `String(x)`. This is done to compare individual characters of the number later.
- The function then compares the string representation of `x` with the reverse of the string. This is done using the `[...x].reverse().join("")` expression.
  - `[...x]` converts the string `x` into an array of characters.
  - `.reverse()` reverses the order of elements in the array.
  - `.join("")` joins the elements of the array back into a string.
- The code uses the `==` operator to compare the original string `x` with its reverse.
- If the original string and its reverse are equal, the function returns `true`, indicating that the number is a palindrome.
- If the original string and its reverse are not equal, the function returns `false`, indicating that the number is not a palindrome.

Overall, the code checks for palindrome property by converting the number to a string, reversing the string, and comparing it with the original string.
