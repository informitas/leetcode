```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map()
    for(let i=0; i<nums.length;i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i]
        if (map.has(complement)) return [map.get(complement), i]
        map.set(nums[i], i)
    }
    return []
};
```

This code solves the Two Sum problem in JavaScript, which involves finding two numbers from a given array (`nums`) that add up to a specific target value. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The code defines a function `twoSum` that takes in two parameters: `nums`, an array of numbers, and `target`, the target value.
- Inside the function, a `Map` object named `map` is created to store the numbers encountered so far and their corresponding indices.
- A `for` loop is used to iterate over the `nums` array.
- For each element at index `i`, the code calculates the `complement` by subtracting the current number `nums[i]` from the target value.
- It checks if the `map` contains the `complement` as a key:
  - If the `complement` is found in the `map`, it means a pair of numbers that add up to the target value has been found. In this case, the function returns an array containing the index of the complement (`map.get(complement)`) and the current index (`i`).
  - If the `complement` is not found in the `map`, it sets the current number `nums[i]` as a key in the `map`, with its index `i` as the value.
- If no solution is found after iterating through the entire array, the function returns an empty array.

Overall, the code efficiently uses a `Map` to keep track of the numbers encountered so far. By checking for complements in the map, it determines the two numbers that add up to the target value.
