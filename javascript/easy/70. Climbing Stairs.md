```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var climbStairs = function(n) {
    let one = 1
    let two = 1

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        let tmp = one
        one = one + two
        two = tmp
    }
    return one
};
```

This code defines a function `climbStairs` that calculates the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- It initializes two variables `one` and `two` to represent the number of ways to climb to the current step and the previous step, respectively.
- It starts a loop from `i = 2` up to `n`, representing the steps from the second step to the `n`-th step.
- Inside the loop, it updates `one` by adding the current value of `one` and `two`. This represents the number of ways to reach the current step by either taking one step from the previous step or two steps from two steps ago.
- It updates `two` by assigning it the previous value of `one`. This is done to prepare for the next iteration of the loop where `two` will represent the number of ways to climb to the current step.
- After the loop, the code returns the value of `one`, which represents the total number of ways to climb to the top of the staircase with `n` steps.

Overall, the code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of distinct ways to climb the staircase by iteratively updating the number of ways based on the previous steps.
