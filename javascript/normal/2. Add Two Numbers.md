Certainly! Here's the description of the `addTwoNumbers` function in a README.md format:

# addTwoNumbers Function

The `addTwoNumbers` function takes two singly-linked lists `l1` and `l2` as input and returns a new singly-linked list representing the sum of the input lists.

1. Initialize `head` and `temp` variables to `null`. These variables will be used to create and traverse the new linked list.
2. Initialize the `carry` variable to 0. This variable keeps track of the carry value when adding digits.
3. Enter a loop that continues until both `l1` and `l2` have been traversed entirely.
4. Inside the loop:
   - Calculate the sum of the current digits from `l1` and `l2`, along with the carry value.
   - If `l1` is not null, add its value to the sum and move to the next node.
   - If `l2` is not null, add its value to the sum and move to the next node.
   - Create a new `ListNode` object using the least significant digit of the sum (obtained by performing `% 10` operation). This node represents a digit of the resulting sum and will be added to the new linked list.
   - Update the carry value by dividing the sum by 10 and taking the floor value.
   - If `temp` is null, set it as the head of the new linked list.
   - If `temp` is not null, attach the current node to the `next` property of `temp` and move `temp` to the newly added node.
5. After the loop ends, check if there is still a carry value remaining. If there is, create a new node representing the carry value and add it to the new linked list.
6. Return the `head` of the new linked list, which represents the sum of the input lists.
