        head = ListNode()
        current = head
        carry = 0

        while (l1 != None or l2 != None or carry != 0):
            total = carry
            total += l1.val if l1 else 0
            total += l2.val if l2 else 0

            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)
            carry = total // 10

            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None
            current = current.next

        return head.next
```

This code defines a class `Solution` that contains a method `addTwoNumbers` to add two numbers represented as linked lists. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The code defines a singly-linked list node class `ListNode` with a constructor that initializes the `val` and `next` attributes.
- The `addTwoNumbers` method takes in two linked lists, `l1` and `l2`, as input parameters.
- It initializes a new linked list `head` and a `current` pointer to keep track of the current node.
- A `carry` variable is used to store the carry value during addition.
- The code enters a `while` loop that continues until both `l1` and `l2` have been traversed and there is no carry left.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the `total` by adding the carry and the values of the current nodes in `l1` and `l2` (if they exist).
- It creates a new node in the result linked list with the value `total % 10` and assigns it to the `current.next`.
- The carry is updated by dividing the `total` by 10 (integer division).
- It moves the `l1`, `l2`, and `current` pointers to their next nodes, updating them accordingly.
- Once the loop ends, it returns the `head.next`, which represents the resulting linked list after addition.

Overall, the code performs digit-wise addition of two numbers represented as linked lists, taking care of carry values and creating a new linked list to store the result.
