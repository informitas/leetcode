```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        while val in nums:
            nums.remove(val)
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `removeElement` that removes all occurrences of a specific value `val` from a list of integers `nums`. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `removeElement` method takes in two parameters: `nums`, which represents the list of integers, and `val`, which represents the value to be removed.
- The code uses a `while` loop to iterate as long as `val` is present in `nums`.
- Inside the loop, it uses the `remove` method of the list to remove the first occurrence of `val` from `nums`.
- The loop continues until there are no more occurrences of `val` in `nums`.
- Since the `remove` method modifies the list in-place, there is no explicit return value for this method.

Overall, the code removes all occurrences of a specific value from a list by repeatedly using the `remove` method until the value is no longer present in the list.
