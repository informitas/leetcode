```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        ans = ""
        sortedStrs = sorted(strs)
        first = sortedStrs[0]
        last = sortedStrs[-1]

        for i in range(min(len(first), len(last))):
            if (first[i] != last[i]):
                return ans
            ans += first[i]

        return ans
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `longestCommonPrefix` that finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings `strs`. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `longestCommonPrefix` method takes in a single parameter, `strs`, which is a list of strings.
- It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the longest common prefix.
- The code sorts the strings in lexicographical order using the `sorted` function and assigns the result to `sortedStrs`.
- It assigns the first string from the sorted list to `first` and the last string to `last`.
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through the characters of the shortest string among `first` and `last`.
- Inside the loop, it compares the characters at the same position in `first` and `last`.
  - If the characters are not equal, it means the common prefix ends at this position. In this case, the method returns the `ans`.
  - Otherwise, if the characters are equal, it appends the character to the `ans`.
- After the loop, the method returns the `ans`, which represents the longest common prefix among the strings in `strs`.

Overall, the code finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings by sorting the strings, comparing the characters of the first and last strings, and accumulating the common prefix in the `ans` variable.
