```python
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        number = int(''.join(map(str, digits))) + 1
        numToStr = str(number)
        return [int(numToStr[i]) for i in range(len(numToStr))]
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `plusOne` that takes in a list of digits and returns a new list representing the input number incremented by one. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The code converts the input list `digits` into a single number by joining the elements together as strings using `''.join(map(str, digits))`. The `map(str, digits)` part converts each digit in `digits` into a string, and `join` concatenates them all together.
- It then adds `1` to the converted number to increment it by one and assigns it to the variable `number`.
- The `number` is converted back to a string using `str(number)` and assigned to the variable `numToStr`.
- Finally, a list comprehension `[int(numToStr[i]) for i in range(len(numToStr))]` is used to iterate over each character in the string `numToStr`, convert it back to an integer, and create a new list of integers representing the incremented number.

Overall, the code converts the input list of digits into a number, increments it by one, converts the result back to a string, and then creates a new list of integers representing the incremented number.
