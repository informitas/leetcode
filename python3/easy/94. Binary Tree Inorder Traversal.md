```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def inorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        return self.inorderTraversal(root.left) + [root.val] + self.inorderTraversal(root.right) if root else []
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `inorderTraversal` that performs the inorder traversal of a binary tree. It takes the root node of the tree as input and returns a list containing the values of the nodes visited in inorder.

Here's how the code works:

- The method `inorderTraversal` is a recursive function that performs the inorder traversal.
- It uses the left-root-right order to traverse the tree.
- It first checks if the `root` node exists (i.e., not None). If it does, it performs the traversal; otherwise, it returns an empty list.
- The traversal is done by concatenating the results of the following three parts:
    1. The inorder traversal of the left subtree (`self.inorderTraversal(root.left)`).
    2. The value of the current `root` node (`[root.val]`).
    3. The inorder traversal of the right subtree (`self.inorderTraversal(root.right)`).
- The base case for the recursion is when the `root` is None, in which case an empty list is returned.
- By recursively traversing the left subtree, visiting the current node, and then traversing the right subtree, the code effectively performs the inorder traversal of the binary tree.
- Finally, the method returns the result of the traversal, which is a list containing the values of the nodes visited in inorder.

Note that the code assumes the `TreeNode` class is defined with the specified attributes (`val`, `left`, and `right`), and it uses the `Optional` type hint for the `root` parameter to indicate that it can be None.
