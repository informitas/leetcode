```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        j = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                j += 1
                nums[j] = nums[i]
        return j + 1
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `removeDuplicates` that removes duplicates from a sorted array `nums` and returns the length of the modified array. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `removeDuplicates` method takes in one parameter: `nums`, which represents the sorted array.
- It initializes a variable `j` to keep track of the last index of the unique elements in the array.
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1).
- Inside the loop, it compares the element at index `j` with the element at index `i`.
  - If they are not equal, it means a new unique element is found. It increments `j` by 1, updates the value at index `j` to the new unique element, and moves forward to the next element.
- After the loop, `j` represents the index of the last unique element, so `j + 1` gives the length of the modified array without duplicates.
- The method returns the length of the modified array.

Overall, the code removes duplicates from a sorted array by comparing elements and updating the array in-place to keep only the unique elements.
