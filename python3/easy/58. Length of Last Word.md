```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        splitted = s.strip().split(' ')
        return len(splitted[len(splitted) - 1])
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `lengthOfLastWord` that takes in a string `s` and returns the length of the last word in the string. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The code starts by stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string `s` using the `strip()` method. This removes any whitespace characters from the beginning or end of the string.
- It then splits the stripped string into an array of words using the `split(' ')` method, where the space character `' '` is used as the delimiter. This effectively separates the string into individual words.
- The resulting array `splitted` contains all the words from the stripped string.
- Finally, the code returns the length of the last word in the `splitted` array by accessing the last element with `splitted[len(splitted) - 1]` and calculating its length using the `len()` function.

Overall, the code strips the input string, splits it into words, and returns the length of the last word in the string.
