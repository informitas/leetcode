        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in hash_map:

## Description

The provided code solves the Two Sum problem, which aims to find two numbers from a given list that add up to a specific target value. The code utilizes a hash map for efficient solution retrieval.

## Implementation

The code defines a class `Solution` with a method `twoSum`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the method's implementation:

1. Initialize an empty hash map (`hash_map`).
2. Iterate over the input list `nums` using the `enumerate` function to access both the index `i` and the number `num` at each iteration.
3. Calculate the complement by subtracting the current number `num` from the target value.
4. Check if the complement exists in the `hash_map`:
   - If the complement is found, it means a pair of numbers that add up to the target value has been found. Return a list containing the index of the complement (`hash_map[complement]`) and the current index (`i`).
   - If the complement is not found, add the current number `num` as a key in the `hash_map`, with its index `i` as the value.
5. If no solution is found after iterating through the entire list, return an empty list.
