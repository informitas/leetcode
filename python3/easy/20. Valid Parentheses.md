```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        for char in s:
            if char == '{':
                stack.append('}')
                continue
            elif char == '[':
                stack.append(']')
                continue
            elif char == '(':
                stack.append(')')
                continue

            if not len(stack): return False
            elif stack.pop() != char:
                return False
        return not len(stack)
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isValid` that checks if a given string `s` contains valid parentheses. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `isValid` method takes in a single parameter, `s`, which represents the input string containing parentheses.
- It initializes an empty list `stack` to simulate a stack data structure.
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate through each character `char` in the input string `s`.
- Inside the loop, it performs the following operations:
  - If the character is an opening parenthesis (`{`, `[`, or `(`), it pushes the corresponding closing parenthesis onto the stack using `stack.append()`.
  - If the character is a closing parenthesis, it checks if it matches the top element of the stack (the expected closing parenthesis).
    - If they match, it removes the top element from the stack using `stack.pop()`.
    - If they don't match, it means the parentheses are invalid, and the method returns `False`.
- After the loop, the method checks if the stack is empty.
  - If it is empty, it means all parentheses were matched correctly, and the method returns `True`.
  - If it is not empty, it means there are unmatched parentheses, and the method returns `False`.

Overall, the code uses a stack to check if a string contains valid parentheses by matching opening and closing parentheses. It iterates through each character of the input string, pushing opening parentheses onto the stack and checking if closing parentheses match the top element of the stack. At the end, it checks if the stack is empty to determine the validity of the parentheses.
