```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(m, m + n):
            nums1[i] = nums2[i - m]
        nums1.sort()
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `merge` that takes four parameters: `nums1`, `m`, `nums2`, and `n`. It merges the elements from `nums2` into `nums1` in a sorted order. Here's how the code works:

- The method starts by using a loop to iterate over the range from `m` to `m + n`. This loop is used to append the elements from `nums2` to the end of `nums1`.
- Inside the loop, it assigns `nums2[i - m]` to `nums1[i]`. This copies the elements from `nums2` into the corresponding positions in `nums1`.
- After the loop, the code calls the `sort()` method on `nums1` to sort its elements in ascending order. The `sort()` method modifies the list in-place.

Overall, the code merges the elements from `nums2` into `nums1` and sorts the resulting list in ascending order. The modifications are done in-place, meaning the original `nums1` list is modified directly.
