```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        dict = {
            "I": 1,
            "V": 5,
            "X": 10,
            "L": 50,
            "C": 100,
            "D": 500,
            "M": 1000,
        }
        result = 0

        for i in range(len(s)-1):
            if dict[s[i]] < dict[s[(i+1)]]:
                result -= dict[s[i]]
            else:
                result += dict[s[i]]
        return result + dict[s[-1]]
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `romanToInt` that converts a Roman numeral string `s` to its corresponding integer value. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `romanToInt` method takes in a single parameter, `s`, which represents the Roman numeral string to be converted.
- It initializes a dictionary `dict` that maps each Roman numeral character to its corresponding integer value.
- A variable `result` is initialized to store the final converted integer value.
- The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the characters in the Roman numeral string, except for the last character.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the value of the current character is less than the value of the next character.
  - If the value of the current character is less than the value of the next character, it means a subtraction is needed. In this case, the value of the current character is subtracted from the `result`.
  - Otherwise, if the value of the current character is greater than or equal to the value of the next character, it means no subtraction is needed. In this case, the value of the current character is added to the `result`.
- After the loop, the code adds the value of the last character in the string to the `result`.
- Finally, the method returns the `result`, which represents the converted integer value.

Overall, the code converts a Roman numeral string to its corresponding integer value by iterating through the characters, applying the necessary rules for subtraction and addition, and accumulating the result in the `result` variable.
