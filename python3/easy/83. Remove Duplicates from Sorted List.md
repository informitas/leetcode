    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head == None:
            return head
        curr = head
        while curr.next != None:
            if curr.val == curr.next.val:
                tmp = curr.next
                curr.next = curr.next.next
                del tmp
            else:
                curr = curr.next
        return head
```

This code is an implementation of the `deleteDuplicates` method in a class called `Solution` for removing duplicates from a sorted singly-linked list. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The method takes a parameter `head`, which represents the head of the linked list.
- It checks if the `head` is `None`, indicating an empty list. In this case, it returns `None` since there are no duplicates to remove.
- If the list is not empty, it initializes a variable `curr` to point to the `head` of the list.
- It uses a loop that continues as long as `curr.next` is not `None`, indicating that there are more nodes to process.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the value of the current node (`curr.val`) is equal to the value of the next node (`curr.next.val`). If they are equal, it means there is a duplicate node.
- To remove the duplicate node, it creates a temporary variable `tmp` to hold a reference to the next node (`curr.next`).
- It updates the `next` pointer of the current node (`curr.next`) to skip the next node and point to the node after it (`curr.next.next`).
- It deletes the temporary variable `tmp` to free the memory occupied by the duplicate node.
- If the values are not equal, it means the current node is distinct, and it moves `curr` to the next node by assigning `curr.next` to `curr`.
- After the loop, the method returns the modified `head` of the linked list, where duplicates have been removed.

Overall, the code traverses the linked list and removes duplicates by adjusting the `next` pointers of the nodes. It only keeps the distinct nodes in the resulting list.
