```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        first, second = 1, 1

        for i in range(n-1):
            tmp = first
            first = first + second
            second = tmp
        return first
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `climbStairs` that calculates the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of a staircase with `n` steps. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- It initializes two variables `first` and `second` to represent the number of ways to climb to the current step and the previous step, respectively. Both are initially set to 1 because there is only one way to climb the first step.
- It uses a loop that iterates `n-1` times, representing the steps from the second step to the `n`-th step.
- Inside the loop, it updates `first` by adding the current value of `first` and `second`. This represents the number of ways to reach the current step by either taking one step from the previous step or two steps from two steps ago.
- It updates `second` by assigning it the previous value of `first`. This is done to prepare for the next iteration of the loop where `second` will represent the number of ways to climb to the current step.
- After the loop, the code returns the value of `first`, which represents the total number of ways to climb to the top of the staircase with `n` steps.

Overall, the code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of distinct ways to climb the staircase by iteratively updating the number of ways based on the previous steps.
