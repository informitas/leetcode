```python
class Solution:
    def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        ans = len(nums)

        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                start = mid + 1
            else:
                ans = mid
                end = mid - 1
        return ans
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `searchInsert` that finds the index where a target value should be inserted in a sorted list of integers `nums` and returns it. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `searchInsert` method takes in two parameters: `nums`, which represents the sorted list of integers, and `target`, which represents the value to be inserted.
- The code initializes two pointers, `start` and `end`, to the start and end indices of the list.
- It also initializes a variable `ans` to the length of the list, assuming the target value should be inserted at the end of the list.
- The code uses a binary search algorithm to find the correct insertion position.
- Inside the while loop, it calculates the midpoint index `mid` using integer division.
- It then compares the value at index `mid` with the target value.
  - If they are equal, it means the target value is already present at index `mid`, so the method returns `mid`.
  - If the value at index `mid` is less than the target value, it means the target value should be inserted to the right of `mid`, so it updates `start` to `mid + 1`.
  - If the value at index `mid` is greater than the target value, it means the target value should be inserted to the left of `mid`, so it updates `ans` to `mid` and updates `end` to `mid - 1`.
- After the while loop, if the target value was not found in the list, the method returns `ans`, which represents the correct insertion position.

Overall, the code performs a binary search to find the index where a target value should be inserted in a sorted list and returns the result.
