```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        return max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right)) + 1
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `maxDepth`. Here's how the code works:

- The `maxDepth` method takes a `root` node as input and first checks if the root is `None`. If it is, it means the tree is empty, so it returns `0`.
- If the root is not `None`, it recursively calls the `maxDepth` method on the left and right subtrees of the root, using the `self.maxDepth` function.
- The recursion continues until it reaches the base case: when the current node is `None`. In this case, it returns `0`.
- As the recursion unwinds, it compares the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees using the `max` function and adds 1 to account for the current level.
- Finally, the method returns the maximum depth of the tree.

Note that the code assumes the `TreeNode` class is defined with the specified attributes (`val`, `left`, and `right`), and it uses the `None` comparison to check for empty nodes.
