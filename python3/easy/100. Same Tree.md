```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        if not p or not q or p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isSameTree` that checks whether two binary trees are the same. It takes the root nodes of the two trees, `p` and `q`, as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the trees are the same.

Here's how the code works:

- The method `isSameTree` is a recursive function that checks the equality of the trees.
- It first checks if both `p` and `q` are None. If they are, it returns True since two empty trees are considered the same.
- It then checks if either `p` or `q` is None (but not both). If that's the case, it returns False since one tree is empty while the other is not, indicating they are not the same.
- It also checks if the values of the current nodes `p.val` and `q.val` are different. If they are, it returns False since the trees cannot be the same.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it recursively calls the `isSameTree` function on the left subtrees (`p.left` and `q.left`) and the right subtrees (`p.right` and `q.right`).
- The recursion continues until the base cases are reached: when both `p` and `q` are None (indicating two empty trees) or when the values of the current nodes are different.
- If all recursive calls return True (indicating the left and right subtrees are the same), the method returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Note that the code assumes the `TreeNode` class is defined with the specified attributes (`val`, `left`, and `right`), and it uses the `Optional` type hint for the `p` and `q` parameters to indicate that they can be None.
