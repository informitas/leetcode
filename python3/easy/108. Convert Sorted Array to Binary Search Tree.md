```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return None

        mid = len(nums) // 2
        currentTree = TreeNode(nums[mid])

        currentTree.left = self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[:mid])
        currentTree.right = self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[mid+1:])

        return currentTree
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `sortedArrayToBST` that takes an input array `nums` representing a sorted array of numbers and returns the corresponding balanced binary search tree (BST). Here's how the code works:

- The method first checks if the length of the `nums` array is 0. If it is, it means there are no elements to construct the tree, so it returns `None`.
- If the length of the `nums` array is not 0, the method calculates the index of the middle element as `mid` using integer division (`//` operator).
- It creates a new `TreeNode` object called `currentTree` with the value of `nums[mid]`. This value becomes the root of the subtree being constructed.
- The method recursively calls `sortedArrayToBST` on the left half of the `nums` array (from index 0 to `mid - 1`) to construct the left subtree of the `currentTree`.
- Similarly, it recursively calls `sortedArrayToBST` on the right half of the `nums` array (from index `mid + 1` to the end) to construct the right subtree of the `currentTree`.
- Finally, it assigns the constructed left and right subtrees to the `currentTree.left` and `currentTree.right` attributes, respectively, and returns the `currentTree` node.

Note that the code assumes the `TreeNode` class is defined with the specified attributes (`val`, `left`, and `right`), and it uses list slicing to divide the input array into left and right halves.
