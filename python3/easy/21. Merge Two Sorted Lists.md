            else:

                curr = curr.next
                list2 = list2.next

```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `mergeTwoLists` that merges two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2` into a single sorted linked list. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `mergeTwoLists` method takes in two parameters: `list1` and `list2`, which represent the heads of the respective linked lists.
- It initializes two variables, `curr` and `head`, to a new instance of the `ListNode` class. Both variables initially point to the same node, which serves as the head of the merged list.
- The code uses a `while` loop to iterate until either `list1` or `list2` becomes `None` (reaching the end of either list).
- Inside the loop, it compares the values of the current nodes in `list1` and `list2`.
  - If the value of the current node in `list1` is smaller, it creates a new node with that value and appends it to the merged list. Then it moves the `curr` pointer and advances `list1` to the next node.
  - If the value of the current node in `list2` is smaller or equal, it performs the same steps with `list2` instead.
- After the loop, there might still be remaining nodes in either `list1` or `list2`. The code checks if either list still has nodes and appends the remaining nodes to the merged list by updating the `next` pointers accordingly.
- Finally, it returns the `next` node of the `head`, which represents the merged list.

Overall, the code merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list by comparing the values of the current nodes and creating a new merged list using the `ListNode` class.
