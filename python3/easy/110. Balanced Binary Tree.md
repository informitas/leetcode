# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root):
            if root is None:
                return 0
            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)
            if left == -1 or right == -1 or abs(left - right) > 1:
                return -1
            return 1 + max(left, right)
        return dfs(root) != -1
```

This code implements the `isBalanced` function in the `Solution` class. Here's how the code works:

- The `isBalanced` function takes a `root` node of a binary tree and determines whether the tree is balanced or not.
- It defines a nested function `dfs` (depth-first search) that takes a `root` node as an argument and returns the height of the subtree rooted at that node.
- If the `root` is `None`, indicating an empty subtree, the `dfs` function returns 0.
- Otherwise, it recursively calculates the height of the left and right subtrees using the `dfs` function.
- If the height of either subtree is -1 or the absolute difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, it means the tree is unbalanced. In this case, the `dfs` function returns -1.
- Otherwise, it returns 1 plus the maximum height between the left and right subtrees.
- In the main `isBalanced` function, it calls `dfs` with the `root` node to calculate the height of the entire tree.
- If the result of `dfs(root)` is not -1, it means the tree is balanced, so the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that the tree is unbalanced.

Note that the code assumes the `TreeNode` class is defined with the specified attributes (`val`, `left`, and `right`).
