```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        s = []
        tmp = 0
        i, j = len(a) - 1, len(b) - 1

        while i >= 0 or j >= 0 or tmp:
            if i >= 0:
                tmp += int(a[i])
                i -= 1
            if j >= 0:
                tmp += int(b[j])
                j -= 1
            s.append(str(tmp % 2))
            tmp //= 2

        return ''.join(reversed(s))
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `addBinary` that takes in two binary strings `a` and `b` and returns their sum as a binary string. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- It initializes an empty list `s` to store the result string and a variable `tmp` to store the carry.
- The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to the lengths of `a` and `b` minus 1, respectively, representing the indices of the rightmost digits in the input strings.
- The code enters a loop that continues until there are no more digits to process in both `a` and `b`, and there is no remaining carry (`tmp` is non-zero).
- Inside the loop, it adds the corresponding digits from `a` and `b` to the carry `tmp`, taking care of the cases when there are no more digits in one of the strings.
- The sum modulo 2 (`tmp % 2`) is appended to the list `s`, representing the current digit in the result.
- The carry is divided by 2 (`tmp //= 2`) to compute the next carry for the next iteration.
- Once the loop finishes, the list `s` contains the binary digits of the sum in reverse order.
- The code returns the joined elements of `s` after reversing it, producing the final binary sum.

Overall, the code iterates over the input binary strings from right to left, computes the sum digit by digit, handles the carry, and builds the resulting binary sum in reverse order before returning it as a string.
