```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        x = str(x)
        if len(x) == 1:
            return True

        return x == x[::-1]
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `isPalindrome` that checks whether a given integer `x` is a palindrome. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `isPalindrome` method takes in a single parameter, `x`, which represents the number to be checked for palindrome property.
- It first checks if `x` is negative. If `x` is negative, it cannot be a palindrome, so the method returns `False`.
- The code converts the integer `x` to a string using `str(x)`. This is done to compare individual characters of the number later.
- If the length of the string `x` is 1, it means `x` is a single-digit number and is considered a palindrome (e.g., 5, 9). In this case, the method returns `True`.
- Finally, the method compares the string `x` with its reverse, which is obtained using the `x[::-1]` syntax.
  - The `x[::-1]` expression reverses the order of characters in the string `x`.
  - The code uses the `==` operator to compare the original string `x` with its reverse.
- If the original string and its reverse are equal, the method returns `True`, indicating that the number is a palindrome.
- If the original string and its reverse are not equal, the method returns `False`, indicating that the number is not a palindrome.

Overall, the code checks for palindrome property by converting the number to a string, comparing it with its reverse, and handling special cases such as negative numbers and single-digit numbers.
