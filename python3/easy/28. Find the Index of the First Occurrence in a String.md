```python
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if needle not in haystack:
            return -1
        return haystack.index(needle)
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `strStr` that finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring `needle` within a string `haystack` and returns it. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

- The `strStr` method takes in two parameters: `haystack`, which represents the string to search within, and `needle`, which represents the substring to search for.
- The code first checks if `needle` is not present in `haystack` using the `in` operator.
- If `needle` is not found in `haystack`, the method returns -1 to indicate that the substring is not present.
- If `needle` is present in `haystack`, the code uses the `index` method of the `haystack` string to find the index of the first occurrence of `needle`.
- The `index` method returns the index of the first occurrence of `needle` within `haystack`.
- The method then returns the result of `haystack.index(needle)`.

Overall, the code finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring within a string by using the `index` method and returns the result. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.
